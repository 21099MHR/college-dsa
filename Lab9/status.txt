The program itself - for once! - compiles and runs correctly. No major issues.

One small issue is that I hard-coded the Array's size to 5; I couldn't figure
out for the life of me how to set up an Array with a passed in size. Apologies.

As for Part B, I just don't understand Big O notation. Once again, my apologies.
