Lab 9 was a ride.

Bubble Sort and Improved Bubble sort were simple enough to grasp, and as such
were done fairly easily, but I hit a brick wall regarding the latter two
methods of sorting.

I understood at a fundamental level what I was doing, but it just... wasn't
clicking until today - Tuesday, April 14th - when I realized what I was doing
incorrectly.

I was overcomplicating things when the answer was glaringly obvious.

I tried to set the two for loops as 0 and 1 so they were parallel - no. That
didn't work whatsoever. Once I had the thought to make one start at the end?
Everything worked out.

It also led me to figuring out how to do 'true' randomness but it was such a
hassle to set up for this project that I opted not to.
