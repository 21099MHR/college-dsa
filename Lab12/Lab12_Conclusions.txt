Lab 12 was a breath of fresh air.

I had a hard time starting, but the moment I figured it out, it just all clicked
with no problems whatsoever.

I have a sinking feeling I screwed *something* up but the fact it compiles with
no issues is a win in my book.

In general, it helped nail down the final few fundamentals I was kind of
(incredibly) shaky on.

It was a good run.
