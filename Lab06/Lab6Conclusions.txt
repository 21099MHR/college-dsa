Lab 6 was... in a word, challenging.

It was a genuine pain in the rear to get working at points, but I knew how the
lab was supposed to function once I got over my personal chokepoint in Problem 2
and that's what I had to aim for.

 And even then, my biggest challenge in Problem 2 was properly updating Front
 and Back for the DEQ, which reminded me that math is simultaneously complicated
 and incredibly simple.

I see the place for Queues; they're a smaller version of the CDLS while
retaining part of the functionality. That being said, the CDLS's functions are
simpler while giving up that space.

Its an interesting tradeoff for space VS ease of use, and something I'll have to heavily considering going forward.
