My rationale for using the two SLS based databases for this midterm was simple;
they were effective, simple, and provided the utility I needed for this
assignment.

A Queue was exactly the type of database I needed for processing the first-come,
first-serve type of input. Enqueue and Dequeue were the perfect tools for the
job, and the SLS based Queue kept size down by only allocating memory as it was
needed.

As for the Stack, its similar; the Stack's push and pop were the tools I needed
in order to handle the FILO style of handling in the pending stack, and again
kept the size down by only allocating memory as required.

The methods were also incredibly easy to implement for the assignment, and
provided adequate utility.
