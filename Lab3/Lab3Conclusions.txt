LAB 3 CONCLUSIONS

Lab 3 was interesting - it really sold how inefficient Arrays and ArrayLists can be, even when they do have their uses occasionally.

I've never had to reverse a collection myself, honestly, or at least never a
LinkedList. Figuring that out was cool but I feel like there's a much, MUCH
more efficient way of going about that.

My greatest takeaway is that LinkedLists are slightly more complex to work with
than an Array but the benefits are much greater. Additionally, if you can get
the Collection working with an Array/ArrayList, its incredibly easy to convert
it over to a LinkedList by minor tweaks.
