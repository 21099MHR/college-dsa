I feel  kinda shakey on the analysis but it is what it is at this point.

What I got out of this lab was a deeper understanding of how the LinkedArray
really works. Its so simple to make it circular *at the cost* of memory, which
is an important lesson to take out of things.

Efficiency isn't just something you get - the give and take between efficiency
and simplicity isn't 1:1, so you need to carefully measure things out.
