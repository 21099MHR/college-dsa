Space Complexity Analysis

1. Critical Operations
   Critical operations for this program are find(), get(), add(), and remove().

2. Count # of Critical Operations
   4 total.

3. Express # of Critical Operations as a Function
   numItems = q
   Each item has a front and back, therefore making it 3 times bigger, and the
   equation:

   4 * 3(q) = 12 bytes

Time Complexity Analysis

isEmpty() - 0
size() - 0
removeAll - 0
toString - 0

get()
BC - 0
WC - (n-1)/2 (because of the ability to go backwards)
AC - (n-1)/4

add()
BC - 0
WC - (n-1)/2
AC  (n-1)/4

remove()
BC - 0
WC - n/2
AC - n+1/4
