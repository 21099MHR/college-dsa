This was a bit of a doozy. Not being able to test my work afterwards is not
doing a lot for my confidence.

Conceptually, I understand *why* we're using KeyedItem, but it feels like
KeyedItem only makes the program more complicated than it needs to be for our
purposes.

That being said, this lab helped remind me how to write a Recursive function,
so that's appreciated.
