My head hurts.

Lab 8 was not difficult in concept, and the first two parts of it weren't - I
had a logical error here and there, but I somehow made it out of those unscathed
and ready to work on 3.

I have a headache trying to get Problem 3 to work. I understand it
*conceptually* but the lack of availability for tutoring is... Rough, to say the
least.

I tried. I really did.
