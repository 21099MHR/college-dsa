Everything runs perfectly fine for Problems 1 and 2, there is an issue with
Problem 3.

My implementation failed somewhere, and while it *compiles*, the sample
output shows how the inserted items are in the wrong order. b should be after
a and its clearly not.

In addition, I couldn't figure out how to get it to print where items are in a
clean fashion... or at all.

Those are the only *glaring* issues with this lab.
