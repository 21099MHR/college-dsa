Generics are *funky.*

They are incredibly powerful, but *incredibly* funky at the same time; there was
a bit of a learning curve to converting from a straight Object type to the
generic T type, but once I got that, it was smooth sailing.

Really, the thing that I got the most of out of this lab (outside of the use of
Queues and Generics)?

REMEMBER TO UPDATE YOUR VARIABLES!

I spent *so long* trying to figure out what was causing the math to bug out,
only to realize after a good night's sleep, *I* was the cause of the bad math!

Such a novice error to make and somehow, I did it.
